# SecureMobileApp
## How do I ensure user is the right one starting the app ?
The user has to enter his key (given by the bank). The real key is hidden in a C++ script. Then, when the user launches the app, it will verify if the key entered by the user is the same as the real id of the user.
## How do I securely save user's data on the phone ?
I crypted the data and store it in a .txt file on the phone. The key to encrypt and decrypt is stored in a C++ script. I used AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING as transformation.
## How did I hide the API url ?
I hided the API url in a C++ script.
