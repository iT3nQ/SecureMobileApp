# SecureMobileApp
## How do I ensure user is the right one starting the app ?
I created a .txt file on the phone named id.txt, this file replace the action of the user entering his credentials on the app. Then, when the user launches the app, it will verify if the id entered by the user (content of id.txt) is the same as the real id of the user (stored in a C++ script).
## How do I securely save user's data on the phone ?
I crypted the data and store it in a .txt file on the phone. The key to encrypt and decrypt is stored in a C++ script, because it is barely unrecoverable.
## How did I hide the API url ?
I hided the API url in a C++ script.
